<pre><font size="4.59">
There are 87 different species of kingfisher in the world, but only one, Alcedo atthis, breeds in Europe.<br>
Our kingfisher has a huge world distribution, and can be found as far east as the Solomon Islands.<br>
There are several other species of kingfisher that look much like our bird:<br>
The largest kingfisher in the world is Australia’s laughing kookaburra. <br>
<br>It weighs up to 500gm, or 15 times as much as our bird.<br>
To differentiate our kingfisher from the other 86 species, it is officially known as the river kingfisher.<br>
Many of the world’s kingfishers don’t eat fish and rarely go near water.<br></font>

	Talking of the brain, their forebrain is very developed. This means that they are intelligent.<br>
	Why so? Because forebrain is where the intelligence of a creature is regulated.<br>
	While staying on the subject of brain, it is worth saying that <br>
	the anatomy of a crow’s brain is very similar to that of a human brain.<br>
	Crows can be found in every continent of this planet <br>
	barring Antarctica. No matter where you go, you will find this bird.<br>
	The scientific name of crow is Corvus brachyrhynchos. <br>
	It belongs to the family Covidae and to the genus Corvus.<br>
	Crows are pretty old.<br>

<br>they fly and hide in the trees.<br>

  Chickens can distinguish among more than 100 faces of members of their species<br>
	Chickens have full-colour vision, just like we do.<br>
	And they tell each other about what they see. <br>
	hickens communicate with more than 24 vocalisations, <br>
	ach with a distinct meaning, including warning their friends about different types of predators or <br>
	letting their mothers know whether they’re comfortable.<br>
	They slurp grass like spaghetti. Yes, you read that right!<br>
	Chickens are the closest living relative to the T. rex, though perhaps not quite as scary!<br></font>
